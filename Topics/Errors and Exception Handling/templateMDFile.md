## Error and Exception Handling
Programs have a possibility of trying to execute code that may cause the program to crash. A programmer can prevent this by using exception handling, which will enclose a block of code and not execute it if it causes any exceptions by 'catching' the exception. The programmer can then decide to do something else if this happens. Errors are different from exceptions in that they mainly occur in the compile/ runtime environment, and therefore, they cannot be prevented by trying to 'catch' them like exceptions, as exceptions are caused directly by the application. Errors cannot be recovered from, meaning the application will crash. 

Errors will be discussed more in paragraph form than example code. Exceptions will be in example code format.

## Java's Implementation
*The classes may be ignored. Please start with main, as this will go in-depth with Java's error and exception handling.*
```java

```

## Swift's Implementation
*The classes may be ignored. Please start after the class declarations, as this will go in-depth with Swift's error and exception handling.*
