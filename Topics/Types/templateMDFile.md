# Comparison of Types
## This document will discuss types for Java and Swift.
Swift and Java are relatively similar in that they both have value and reference types.

## Java's Types
In Java however their value types are called primitive types. These primitive types are: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float and double.
Following are some code examples of Java primitive types.
```
int a = 2;
char b = 'b';
boolean f = false;
double d = 3.40;
```
