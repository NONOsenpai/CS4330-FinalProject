# Language Purpose/ Genesis
### This topic will go over the following queries:
* #### Why was the language created?
* #### What problems was the language trying to address?
* #### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
* #### And, most importantly, what _is_ object oriented programming (OOP)?
<br></br>
## Object Orientd Programming aka. OOP
#### _A brief background of what OOP is all about will help you understand later topics in this repository._

OOP has a few basic ideas and concepts. [Every OOP language deals with](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/) objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages. Classes, inheritance, and interfaces will be addressed in their respective folders in 'Topics.'

> "An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior." The state of an object is a field it has, and the behaviour is the actions an object can take or perform.

Objects typically model objects and things we use on a daily basis. For example, a lawn mower is object that has two behaviours: on and off, and it has multiple states or fields: four wheels, brand name, motor, bag, etc.

> "A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner." 

A package can be likened to a large folder system, such as 'Topics' in this repository. All the information and details pertaining to the topic 'Classes' would be within the 'Classes' folder. You wouldn't find any code examples from 'Reflection' within 'Classes,' as this would make finding the information you need much harder.

The most important aspect of OOP are the principles _(the first four are the main principles; the rest are important but 'secondary')_:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance
    *This will be addressed in 'Inheritance and Extension.'*
5. Composition

## Java
#### _We'll begin with Java, as it is much older than Swift._

Java was developed in 1995 to [union digital consumer devices and the internet](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javahistory-index-198355.html). It would replace C/ C++, enable the creation of web applications, have portability, and operate in distributed environments.

There were [five main goals](http://www.freejavaguide.com/history.html) Java was developed for (ie. the problems Java was made to address):
1. OOP
    > This style of programming was developed so that similar elements are grouped together.<br></br>
    It was also developed to create more generic software that could be **reused**.
    Resuability of code, or modularizing code, is one of the most important aspects of computer science. It allows for less storage, cleaner and more readable code. Code should be understandable and not repetitive. <br></br>

2. Execution on multiple operating systems
    > There was a large issue with 'platform independence' when coding came about. One could not simply write a program and try to run it on all platforms one is using. Java developers created a Java byte language that would be converted to the machine's 'native' language for execution and running. Furthermore, standardized libraries were developed to allow for easier implementation of threading and graphics, etc.
3. Built-in support
    > All the pieces of java were to come together. They made it so that it actually came with its own compiler and debugging software. For most other languages, at the time, support came separately and needed to be downloaded and may have even needed to be connected with other support software.
4. Execute from remote sources securely
    > Secure execution of a programming is extremely important to protect data. Making that execution remote would allow for more difficult access to data from those who would try to compromise the software's protection and access data.
5. Easy to use
    > Java was to be a combination of all the 'better' parts of OOP. If everyone took everything thing that they liked and was considered useful (and **needed**), then a 'perfect' language would be created.  <br></br>
    OOP was designed to make code modularized and 'simple.' Combining everything that worked had seemed like the great new breakthrough the developers of Java, and everyone else, was looking for.

Java was developed more to combine aspects of a new and radical programming ideal than to *actively* replace other languages; however, because of the mostly positive response to OOP, it came to replace many of the popular languages at the time, such as C and C++.

## Swift

[Apple states](https://www.apple.com/swift/):
> "Swift is a robust and intuitive programming language created by Apple for building apps for iOS, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. Itâ€™s designed to give developers more freedom than ever. Swift is easy to use and open source, so anyone with an idea can create something incredible."
