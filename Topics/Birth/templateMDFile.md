# Language Purpose/ Genesis
## This topic will go over the following queries:
* ### Why was the language created?
* ### What problems was the language trying to address?
* ### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

## Java
### _We'll begin with Java, as it is much older than Swift._

Java was developed in 1995 to [union digital consumer devices and the internet](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javahistory-index-198355.html). It would replace C/ C++, enable the creation of web applications, have portability, and operate in distributed environments.

There were [five main goals](http://www.freejavaguide.com/history.html) Java was developed for (ie. the problems Java was made to address):
1. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  1. This style of programming was developed so that similar elements are grouped together.

  1. It was also developed to create more generic software that could be **reused**.
    1. Resuability of code, or modularizing code, is one of the most important aspects of computer science. It allows for less storage, cleaner and more readable code. Code should be understandable and not repetitive.

2. Execution on multiple operating systems
  1. 
3. Built-in support
4. Execute from remote sources securely
5. Easy to use

Java was developed more to combine aspects of a new and radical programming ideal than to *actively* replace other languages; however, because of the mostly positive response to OOP, it came to replace many of the popular languages at the time, such as C and C++.
