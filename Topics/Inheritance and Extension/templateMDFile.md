# Inheritance/ Extension
#### *This document will explain, compare, and give examples of how Java and Swift implement inheritance.*


## Inheritance and Extension
Inheritance is when an object is built up from another object; this is usually explained as an IS-A relationship. For example, vegetables are healthy foods that humans (should) eat. A cabbage *is* a vegetable, and a carrot *is* a vegetable; in this instance, vegetables would be a 'parent' (extended) class and cabbage and carrot would be two different 'child' (inheriting) classes. Each 'child' of an object is a more specific version of its parent; another example of this is: a january_king_cabbage is a cabbage is a vegetable (similar to how taxonomy works). 

In programming implementation, a 'child' class is said to *extend* a 'parent' class, and the 'child' class is said to have *inherited* the states and behaviours of the 'parent' class.
