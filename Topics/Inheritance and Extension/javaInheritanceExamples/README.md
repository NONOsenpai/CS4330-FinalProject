# Hello!

It looks like you want to practice using this example!
To do so, you'll need to install [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/)!
Next, you'll want to download the folder: javaInheritanceExamples.
Finally, you'll want to refer to NetBeans for how to use it and open the project (note: this folder is a *project*, which means that you need everything in the folder to run and play with the program!)
