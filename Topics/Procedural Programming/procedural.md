# Procedural programming
#### *This document will discuss procedural programming in the context of Java and Swift.*

## What is procedural programming?
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of a procedure call. Procedures can be understood as functions that carry out a series of steps. These functions can be called at any moment or by another function.

## Support
Procedural Programming is a different way of thinking than Object Oriented Programming. In Procedural Programming, code is treated separately from data; you pass parameters, data structures, that procedures could modify. In Object Oriented Programming, like Java or Swift, code and data are wrapped in objects, which are instances of [classes](https://github.com/mromerom/CS4330-FinalProject/blob/master/Topics/Classes/classes.md).

Most object oriented languages do not support procedural programming, and such is the case for Java and Swift. C++ would be an example of an object oriented language that supports both paradigms.
